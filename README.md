# Brainlove
Backwards compatible Brainfuck extension. Currently supports Macros (Functions) using horribly annoying syntax, as to keep with the spirit of brainfuck. The interpreter handles both Brainfuck and Brainlove files.

:speech_balloon: This project is not optimized, condensed or follows any proper styleguide - it doesn't matter, it's a one-off project.
## Usage
```
python3 interpreter.py [sourcefile]
```
## Examples
The [examples/](https://github.com/frederikgram/brainlove/tree/master/examples) directory contains a few examples of both brainlove and brainfuck applications,
examples of the extended languages features are showcased in the former.
