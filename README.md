Backwards compatible Brainfuck extension. Currently supports Macros (Functions) using horribly annoying syntax, as to keep with the spirit of brainfuck.

The interpreter handles both Brainfuck and Brainlove files.

python3 interpreter.py [sourcefile]
```
## Examples
The [examples/](https://github.com/frederikgram/brainlove/tree/master/examples) directory contains a few examples of both brainlove and brainfuck applications,
examples of the extended languages features are showcased in the former.
